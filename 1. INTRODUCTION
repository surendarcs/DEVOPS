# 1️⃣ WHAT is DevOps?

### Simple definition

**DevOps is a culture, mindset, and set of practices** where:

* Development (Dev)
* Operations (Ops)

**work together as one team**, using **automation**, to deliver software **faster, safer, and more reliably**.

👉 DevOps is **NOT just tools**
👉 DevOps is **NOT a job title first**
👉 DevOps is about **collaboration + automation**

---

# 2️⃣ WHY DevOps was Needed (The Problem)

Before DevOps, companies followed **traditional SDLC models**.

## Traditional Software Development Flow (Pre-DevOps)

```
Requirements → Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
```

Each step is handled by **different teams**.

### Key problems:

* Dev team wants **fast changes**
* Ops team wants **stability**
* Work is thrown “over the wall”
* Manual deployments
* Frequent failures
* Delays
* Blame game

📌 In the story:

* **Developers** finish coding
* **Ops team** deploys manually
* **Testers** face broken environments
* **Emma** (customer) waits
* Business loses money

---

# 3️⃣ WHAT is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?

SDLC is the **process of building software**.

### Common phases:

1. Requirement Gathering
2. Planning
3. Designing
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

---

# 4️⃣ WHY Waterfall Failed for Emma

### Waterfall Model

* Each phase must finish before next starts
* No flexibility
* Changes are hard
* Working software comes very late

📌 Problem for Emma:

* She doesn’t know all requirements upfront
* She wants to **change ideas**
* She wants **early demos**

➡️ Waterfall = ❌

---

# 5️⃣ WHY Agile Was Chosen

### Agile Model

* Work divided into small iterations (2–4 weeks)
* Frequent feedback
* Continuous improvement
* Early delivery

📌 Benefits:

* Emma sees progress early
* Ideas can change
* Faster development

➡️ Agile = ✅

---

# 6️⃣ THE REAL PROBLEM: Agile + Traditional Ops

Even after Agile, **new problems appeared**.

### Why?

* Dev became **fast**
* Ops remained **slow and manual**

### Problems shown in story:

* Frequent deployments
* Ops overloaded
* Deployment failures
* Testers blocked
* Missed deadlines

📌 Root Cause:

> **Dev is Agile, Ops is still Waterfall**

This mismatch created the **“Wall of Confusion”**.

---

# 7️⃣ WHAT is the Wall of Confusion?

```
DEV  |   OPS
-----|------
Fast | Stable
Agile| ITIL
Code | Infra
```

* Dev throws code over the wall
* Ops struggles to deploy
* No shared responsibility
* Blame culture

---

# 8️⃣ ENTER DEVOPS (The Solution)

Reggie realizes:

> “The problem is not people. The problem is the process.”

### DevOps fixes this by:

* Breaking silos
* Encouraging collaboration
* Sharing responsibility
* Automating everything

---

# 9️⃣ HOW DevOps Works (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Culture Change

* Dev + Ops work together
* Shared ownership
* Same goal: **business success**

---

### Step 2: Training

* Dev learns Ops basics
* Ops learns Agile mindset
* Everyone understands end-to-end flow

---

### Step 3: Automation (Core of DevOps)

Everything is automated:

| Area       | Automation             |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Code build | CI pipelines           |
| Testing    | Automated tests        |
| Infra      | Infrastructure as Code |
| Deployment | CD pipelines           |
| Monitoring | Alerts & dashboards    |

📌 No manual steps → fewer errors

---

# 10️⃣ The DevOps Lifecycle (HOW IT LOOKS)

```
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor
        ↑-----------------------------------------------↓
                   Continuous Feedback
```

This is **CI/CD**.

---

# 11️⃣ WHY Automation is Critical

### Manual Process:

* Slow
* Error-prone
* Not repeatable

### Automated Process:

* Fast
* Reliable
* Consistent
* Scalable

📌 In the story:

> “No human intervention → no human errors”

---

# 12️⃣ FINAL RESULT (Business Impact)

### For Emma:

* Faster delivery
* Happy customers
* Business growth

### For Company:

* Reduced deployment time (days → minutes)
* Fewer failures
* Faster feedback
* Competitive advantage

---

# 13️⃣ KEY TAKEAWAYS (EXAM / INTERVIEW READY)

### DevOps is:

* Culture
* Collaboration
* Automation
* Continuous improvement

### DevOps solves:

* Slow delivery
* Deployment failures
* Team silos
* Business delays

---

# 14️⃣ ONE-LINE SUMMARY

> **DevOps is about bringing Development and Operations together using automation to deliver software faster, safer, and continuously.**
